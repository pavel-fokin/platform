Authentication: Magic link-based, passwordless login for candidates and recruiters.
Candidate Dashboard: Profile creation/editing, interview scheduling, and wallet management.
Recruiter Flow: Viewing candidate profiles, booking interviews, making payments (Stripe escrow).
Payments & Escrow: Stripe integration for secure, escrow-based funds management and candidate withdrawals.
Email Notifications: Use SendGrid for transactional emails at key actions (e.g., booking, confirmation).
UI & SSR: Use React Router 7 (with SSR) with ShadCN UI components for a minimal UI.
